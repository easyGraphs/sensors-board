## What is it?

EasyGraphs Sensors Board is a set of sensors that allow you to measure the air quality, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and light intensity, and send these measurements via a Wifi connection to any host.

This board includes the USB-UART interface so you can easily program it using the Arduino IDE.

Board also includes the case for 18650 battery and the TP4056 charger module for it. You can charge the battery again when needed.
